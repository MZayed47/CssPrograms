<h3> My Time-line Posts </h3>
<p class="post"> Not very much fond of posting on my timeline so often.
Most of the time I'm tagged in other friend's posts even during a huge tour or something.
Only dp & cover update is suitable for me. </p>


<h3> My Wall Preferences </h3>
<p class="wall"> Like to keep my family members & closed ones preferable to see them first. </p>
