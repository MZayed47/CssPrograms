<h2> Some things about facebook </h2>
<p class="fb"> Facebook may be accessed by a large range of devices with Internet connectivity, such as desktop, laptop and tablet computers, and smartphones.
<span class="highlight"> After registering to use the site, users can create a customized profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on.</span>
Users can add other users as "friends", exchange messages, post status updates, share photos, videos and links, use various software applications ("apps"), and receive notifications of activity.
Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends".
Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people.
