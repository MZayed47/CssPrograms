<h1> Father of Physics </h1>

<p> "Newton, Galileo and Einstein have all been called "Fathers of Modern Physics."
Newton was called this because of his famous law of motion and gravitation.
Galileo for his role in the scientific revolution and his contributions on observational astronomy.
and Einstein for his groundbreaking theory of relativity. </p>

<h1> Father of Chemistry </h1>

<p> Along with Lavoisier, Boyle, and Dalton, Berzelius is known as the father of modern chemistry.
In 1828 he compiled a table of relative atomic weights, which included all of the elements known at the time. </p>

<h1> Father of Biology </h1>

<p> Aristotle : Father of Biology.
“In the 4th century BC the Greek philosopher Aristotle traveled to Lesvos, an island in the Aegean teeming, then as now, with wildlife.
His fascination with what he found there, and his painstaking study of it, led to the birth of a new science —biology. </p>

<h1> Father of Mathematics </h1>

<p> Archimedes : Greek mathematician Archimedes is widely considered by many to be the "father of mathematics."
He is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity.
He is credited with designing numerous innovative machines, including the screw pump and siege engines. </p>

<p> The most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguably Leonhard Euler.
His contributions range from founding the study of graph theory with the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem,
to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and notations. </p>
