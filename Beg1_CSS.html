<!-- Here we will discuss the points about my FB account -->

<h3> My Profile Updates </h3>
<p class="profile"> Profile update is a simultaneous process.
For every ocassion in the real life, information in the virtual socila media is updated. </p>

<h3> My Time-line Posts </h3>
<p class="posts"> Not very much fond of posting on my timeline so often.
Most of the time I'm tagged in other friend's posts even during a huge tour or something.
Only dp & cover update is suitable for me. </p>

<h3> My Wall Preferences </h3>
<p> Like to keep my family members & closed ones preferable to see them first. </p>
